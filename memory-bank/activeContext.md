# Active Context

## Current Status
- **Phase**: JWT Authentication Implementation Complete
- **Task**: Successfully added JWT authentication with dynamic Gist IDs
- **Next Step**: Ready for production deployment with enhanced authentication

## Recent Activities
1. Implemented JWT authentication system:
   - Added jsonwebtoken library with nodejs_compat flag
   - Created JWT utility functions for token creation/validation
   - Updated auth middleware to support both JWT and legacy Bearer tokens
2. Enhanced API with dynamic Gist ID support:
   - Added new routes with `:gistId` parameter
   - Maintained backward compatibility with legacy endpoints
   - Supports multi-tenant usage patterns
3. Created CLI tool for JWT token generation:
   - `cli/create-token.js` with flexible options
   - Supports custom secrets, expiration times
   - Can embed or omit Gist ID for different use cases
4. Updated all documentation to reflect new capabilities

## Active Decisions

### Technology Choices
- **Framework**: Hono (lightweight, Workers-optimized)
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens (new) + Bearer tokens (legacy)
- **Response Format**: Raw text for GET operations
- **JWT Library**: jsonwebtoken with nodejs_compat for Workers

### Architecture Decisions
- **Dual Authentication**: Support both JWT and legacy Bearer tokens
- **Dynamic Routing**: Gist ID can be in JWT or URL path
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing endpoints still work
- **Stateless Design**: No session management or caching
- **Direct Proxy**: Minimal processing between client and GitHub

## Current Focus
JWT implementation is complete and tested. The API now supports:
1. JWT tokens with embedded GitHub credentials
2. Dynamic Gist ID routing for multi-tenant usage
3. Legacy Bearer token authentication for backward compatibility
4. CLI tool for easy JWT token generation

## Next Steps

### Completed
1. ✅ JWT authentication implementation
2. ✅ Dynamic Gist ID routing
3. ✅ CLI token generator tool
4. ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
5. ✅ Updated documentation and README
6. ✅ Tested all authentication methods

### Ready for User
1. Generate JWT tokens: `node cli/create-token.js --github-token ghp_xxx`
2. Use dynamic endpoints: `/api/gist/{gistId}/file/{filename}`
3. Deploy with JWT_SECRET: `wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET`
4. Existing Bearer token auth continues to work

## Key Considerations

### Security
- JWT tokens contain GitHub tokens - treat with same security
- JWT secrets must be kept secure and rotated regularly
- Tokens can have expiration times for better security
- Never log or expose JWT contents

### Performance
- JWT validation adds minimal overhead
- nodejs_compat flag enables Node.js built-ins
- Still maintains fast cold starts on Workers edge

### User Experience
- Flexible authentication options
- Easy token generation with CLI tool
- Clear migration path from Bearer to JWT
- Multi-tenant support for SaaS use cases

## Implementation Details

### JWT Token Structure
```json
{
  "githubToken": "ghp_...",
  "gistId": "optional_gist_id",
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

### Authentication Flow
1. Check for JWT_SECRET in environment
2. Try to validate as JWT token
3. Fall back to legacy Bearer token if JWT fails
4. Store JWT payload in request context for route handlers

## Dependencies
- User needs to provide:
  - GitHub Personal Access Token (in JWT or env)
  - JWT_SECRET for token validation
  - Optional: Legacy Bearer token for backward compatibility
  - Cloudflare account for deployment

## Risk Mitigation
- **Token Security**: JWT tokens are signed and can expire
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy auth still works
- **Migration Path**: Users can transition at their own pace
- **Multi-tenant**: Each user can access their own Gists securely
